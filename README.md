# Java Programming Exercises (Conditions)

### 1. Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative.
### 2. Write a Java program to get an input from a user and print whether that number is an odd number or an even number.
### 3. Take three numbers from the user and print the greatest number.
### 4. Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.
### 5. Write a Java Program that reads a number in integer value and detects whether that number is a perfect cube number or a perfect square number or not.
### 6. Write a Java Program which reads a character and detects whether that character is a number or not. If the character is a number it should print “It’s a number!” or else if its not a number it should print “It’s not a number!”.
### 7. Write a Java Program which reads the user’s input in integer value and prints whether that number is equal to 0 or is between 1 – 25 or is equal to 25 or greater than 25.
### 8. Write a Java Program to get 3 lengths of a triangle from the user as an input and print whether the triangle is a scalene, isosceles or an equilateral triangle.
### 9. Write a Java Program to get 4 angles of a quadrilateral (except triangle) and detect whether it is valid/proper quadrilateral or not (sum of 4 angles is 360 or not).
### 10. Write a Java Program to get a string from the user and print whether it has less than 10 characters or more than 10 characters.
